# 1.1.2 Total thrust

Here we are, talking about rockets, we cannot leave the thrust(total) formula.


## $F_+$
So we have to mention the variable $F_+$, which is the other physics effects like the gas pressure for jet engines or relativistic effect close to the speed of light.


## $F_\ast$
$F_\ast = F_{ex} + F_+$

------

## Formula

$F_\ast = dm \times v_\ast$ would be the formula for the thrust(total) force or propellent force.

since dm would be "-", let's take the absolute value of it.
$F_\ast = -dm \times v_\ast = dm_p \times v_\ast$
This is one of the most important formula and the fundamental formula to all types of engines.

So is this, it's just $F_\ast = -dm \times v_\ast = dm_p \times v_\ast$ with a little of modification.
$v_\ast = v_{ex} + \frac{F_+}{dm_p}$

The definition of $v_\ast$ is the achievable total impulse of an engine with respect to a given exhaust engine with propellent mass of $m_p$.
This is called the mass-specific impulse: $v_\ast = I_{sp}$

## Fun facts
Saturn V rocket had a mass flow rate of about 2.5 metric tons per second, in total 12.5 tons per second, to achieve the required thrust of 33,000 kN.
