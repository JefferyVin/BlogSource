Work until you no longer have to introduce yourself.

## Good thing

I found a more basic book for Astronautics that Introduces Rockets less in physics and is simpler to read. I think by reading that book, I will be able to have a better understand of how everything works. It's like learning chemistry, teachers always teaches students to use lewis dot diagram first.

Edit (Next morning): Nvm, I was looking at it this morning and yesterday night, the book is too simple...

## Thinkings

I was in the ADRN for shepherd training and I realized that I have a hard time understanding others people's emotion.... I should try to find other ways to help others.
