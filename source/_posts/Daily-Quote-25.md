## Quote

The important thing is not to stop questioning, curiosity has its own reason for existing.
One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mystery of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality.
It is enough if one tries to comprehend only a little of this mystery every day.
    - Einstein
