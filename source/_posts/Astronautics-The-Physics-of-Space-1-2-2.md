# 1.2.2 Pressure Thrust

So let's talk about the jet engine.

## The Algebra Magic

We know that $F = pA$, thus the total Force of a jet engine will be
$\\iint_{S_o}(p-p_\infty)dA - (p_e-p_\infty)A_e$

The second term $F_p = -(p_e - p_\infty)A_e$ is the pressure thrust Force.

And by using Bernoulli effect, we know that $F_ex = \\iint_{S_o}(p - p_\infty)dA = -dm_p \times v_{ex}$ which is the momentum thrust force

## Sum

We can get this equation:
$$\Huge F_\ast = dm_pv_{ex} + (p_e - p_\infty)A_e$$
Ya, I think the simplest way is just to remember this formula.

# My Notes:

I spent a lot of my time outside, thus I wasn't really productive in terms of studying, but I got a lot of the other things done.
I also spent a lot of time figuring out the equation 1.2.11 and 1.2.12.
This chapter is significantly harder than the other small chapters.
