#1.1.1 Repulsion Principle

Rockets, utilized propellents, to move in space. It has a really interesting mechanics that is obvious but at least I haven't really thought about how it work. 1.1.1 have provided a lot of physics behind it.

$p = mv$ is the momentum formula, and the momentum thrust is the major way to push the spacecraft in outer space when there is no water to row on.

------

## Initial Stage

Assume you have a rocket with mass $m$ that is traveling at a velocity(Don't forget its a vector) of $v$ has the momentum of $p = mv$.

------

## Propelling Stage
You start using your fuel. You can treat your rocket as two small systems. #Divide And Conquer


##### Propellents
The propellent is going away at a rate of $dm_p$, with an exhaust velocity of $v_{ex}$.
Therefore we can get $p_p = dm_p \times (v + v_{ex})$. ($v$ is vector, $v_{ex}$ is "negative").

##### Rocket
Rocket's total mass will be decreasing at at rate of $dm$(-). Velocity will be increasing at a rate of $dv(+)$. So the formula is $p_r = (m + dm)(v+dv)$.

------

## Add

By adding the formula, you will get the equation m \star dv = dm \star $v_{ex}$. Because $F = ma$.

$F_{ex} = dm \times v_{ex}$.

Since the F will be "negative", we will change it back to positive by inserting "-" sign in front. Therefore $F_{ex} = -dm \times v_{ex} = dm_p \times v_{ex}$.
