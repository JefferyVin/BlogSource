Found a poster that I made for World history when I was a sophomore. It seems like I still had a lot of creativity and front-end designing skills back then because I was making apps and doing front end designs for my apps. I also used that crystal like front end design for my app..... BUT I CAN'T remember what is that App that I made OMG(The only thing I can remember is the UI is red and white which looks pretty neat)... I guess this is also the reason that I decide to write this blog to keep track of every thing that I have done... Memory is a painful thing, but losing your memory is more painful than that.

Note: I made everything on the poster exept the United States Seal of the President and some other random pictures. Didn't copy the crystal idea from anyone. It still look pretty clean and neat after 2 years. WOW.
