Every one have their humiliating projects that they have made in the spare time.

So here are some of mine and I am forced to share it.


## CodeForces Grinder

This project is made when I was grinding codeforces problems during my first semester in my senior year.
It provide the user a great experience when they are grinding the codeforces problems and provide a downloaded database so the user can be able to grind the problems when they do not have access to the internet.
Here's the demo. [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6Ezis8oy6dv8v5jiJy0k45WXxN3vdv6/view?usp=sharing)

The source code will only be showed in the video.

## PJO Grinder

Same as the Codeforces grinder. PJO is a 3rd party client that links to the PJO online problem database. However, this grinder doesn't have a build in GUI because the problems on PJO is not downloadable.
Here's the demo. [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1foNocDa2nojYrUkngrhZc2JsAuUT1q2Q/view?usp=sharing)

## Location Finder

This is the Loc8ter that we made for the computer science class. This computer demo is used to find location of the desired place you want to find. I didn't put a lot of effort into this project.

_All this project will be kept my Hall of Shame forever_
