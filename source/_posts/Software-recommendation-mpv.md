I started using mpv 2 years ago, and everytime I reinstall my computer since then this software is one of the must-install softwares on my computer.

Install on mac os(if have brew):
brew cask install mpv

This software allows you to listen to music and etc. on terminal or in GUI form, depends on whatever you want.

For music only the command is:
mpv --no-video <Link to video>
