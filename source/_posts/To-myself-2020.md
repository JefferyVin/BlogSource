Hey jeffery, I hope you do well during the year. I wish you will become a more excellent person and didn't give up your dream. I beg you never give up and ... (I'm currently having mixed feelings) Just don't give up. I hope you accomplished what you want.

  Jenny Zhang is too excellent, and I need to spend much more effort in order to approach her. I'm not a gifted person, so I need to spend my time practicing and repeating in order to achieve the same amount of excellence. I really want to be next to you. Kx^2+px+t
